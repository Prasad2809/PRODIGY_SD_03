Prodigy InfoTech Internship: Software Development
Welcome to the Prodigy InfoTech Internship repository! These repository documents are for Task 3 of my internship journey, which focuses on creating innovative, simple, flexible programs.

Task Overview
Develop a program that allows users to store and manage contact information. The program should provide options to add a new contact by entering their name, phone number, and email address. It should also allow users to view their contact list, edit existing contacts, and delete contacts if needed. The program should store the contacts in memory or a persistent storage file.

Knowledge Gained
Task 3 helped me to construct a program that includes structures from C Programming and also to generate logic about the contact listing.
